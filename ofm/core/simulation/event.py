        Calculate the outcome of an event in a soccer game.

        This function takes in the attacking team and defending team as parameters and returns the resulting game state after the event.
        The event is simulated using a transition matrix that represents the probabilities of transitioning from one position on the field to another.
        The transition matrix is based on the team's strategy.

        Parameters:
